# The Responding Dark Laughter

## Discovery Phase:

### 1. Define the System Requirements:
   - Understand the service level agreement (SLA) requirements for uptime.
   - Determine the expected traffic load and scaling requirements.
   - Clarify any security and compliance requirements.

### 2. Choose a Cloud Provider and Container Orchestration Platform:
   - I chose AWS as the cloud provider since it provides the most out of the box solutions. It will be safer bet for future developments.
   - Use k8s for container management, better cloud provider support and general documentation.

## Deployment Phase:

### 3. Use Infrastructure as Code tooling:
   - Use terraform to build a repeatable deployment structure
   - By using terraform we can reduce the amount of code change in case we want to switch cloud provider.

### 4. Create a Container Image:
   - Develop a simple HTTP server application that responds with "42" to GET requests.
   - Dockerize the application in a container image.
   - Push container image to ECR.

### 5. Provision Cloud Resources:
   - Create an EKS cluster. Disable autoscaling.
   - Set up a network, routing, firewall rules for port 80.

### 6. Deploy the Containerized Application:
   - Use k8s to deploy the containerized application.

### 7. Implement Monitoring and Logging:
   - Configure monitoring tools (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana) to track system health and performance.
   - Set up centralized logging (e.g., ELK stack) for debugging and auditing.

## Documentation Phase:

### 8. Developer Guidelines:
    - Document how developers can extend their implementations to run in the PoC environment.
    - By using terraform .tfvars we can simply on which variables developers need to change for deployment.

## Testing and Quality Assurance:

### 9. Automated Testing:
    - Develop unit tests for the application code to ensure functionality.
    - Create end-to-end tests to validate the entire system's behavior.
    - Set up a CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment.
